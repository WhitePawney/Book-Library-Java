# Book-Library-Java
Book Library Management System made in Java + Swing for GUI + Database Integration (Sqllite).

I made this in the second semester of my First Year of Faculty of Computer Science. It has: search books by authors or names (keywords), inserting into database, editing fields, lending, information about persons who lent books and deleting from both tables (books and persons). 

Don't forget to change the path for connecting to the .db file in the code in mainFrame.java class.
